		<h1>Â¿What is the difference between undefined and NULL in JavaScript</h1>
		<p
			>Undefined is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned
			a value. NULL is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as
			a representation of no value.</p
		>
		<p>Undefined is a type itself (undefined) while NULL is an object.</p>
		<p>If you want to assign an empty value to a variable, you can use null.</p>
