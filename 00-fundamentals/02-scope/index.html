	</head>

		<h1>What is Variable Scope in JavaScript?</h1>
		<p>
			In JavaScript, the scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed
			within your code. There are two primary types of scope:
		</p>

		<h2>Global Scope</h2>
		<p>
			Variables declared outside of any function have global scope. They are
			accessible from anywhere within your JavaScript code, including inside
			functions.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
let globalVar = "I'm global!";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessible here
}

myFunction(); // Output: "I'm global!"
  </code></pre>

		<h2>Local Scope</h2>
		<p>
			Variables declared within a function have local scope. They are only
			accessible inside that function. Trying to access them outside the
			function will result in an error.
		</p>

		<pre><code>
function myFunction() {
  let localVar = "I'm local!";
  console.log(localVar); // Accessible here
}

myFunction(); // Output: "I'm local!"
console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
  </code></pre>

		<h2>Block Scope (ES6+)</h2>
		<p>
			Variables declared with `let` and `const` (introduced in ES6) also have
			block scope. This means they are only accessible within the specific block
			of code they are defined in (e.g., inside loops, if statements).
		</p>

		<pre><code>
if (true) {
  let blockVar = "I'm block-scoped!";
  console.log(blockVar); // Accessible here
}

console.log(blockVar); // Error: blockVar is not defined
  </code></pre>

		<h2>Important Considerations</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				**Hoisting (var):** Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top
				of their scope, but their initialization is not. This can lead to
				unexpected behavior if not understood properly.
			</li>
			<li>
				**let and const (ES6+):** Use `let` for variables that might be
				reassigned and `const` for variables that should remain constant. They
				offer better scoping and help prevent accidental modifications.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Best Practices</h2>
		<ul>
			<li
				>Declare variables as close as possible to where they are used to
				improve readability and maintainability.</li
			>
			<li
				>Use `const` by default, and only use `let` when you explicitly need to
				reassign the variable's value.</li
			>
			<li
				>Limit the use of global variables to avoid potential naming conflicts
				and unintended side effects.</li
			>
		</ul>
