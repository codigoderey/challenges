		<h1>What is Hoisting and How Does it Work in JavaScript?</h1>

		<p>
			Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function
			declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
			This behavior can lead to unexpected results if not understood properly.
		</p>

		<h2>Key Points to Remember</h2>
		<ul>
			<li
				>Variables declared with `var` are hoisted, but their initialization is
				not. This means they have an initial value of `undefined`.</li
			>
			<li
				>Function declarations (`function myFunction() {}`) are fully
				hoisted.</li
			>
			<li
				>Function expressions (`const myFunction = function() {}`) and arrow
				functions are not hoisted.</li
			>
			<li
				>Variables declared with `let` and `const` are not hoisted in the
				traditional sense. They are in a "temporal dead zone" until their
				declaration is reached.</li
			>
		</ul>

		<h2>Example: Hoisting in Action</h2>
		<pre><code>
console.log(x); // Output: undefined (variable hoisted, but not initialized)
var x = 10;

myFunction(); // Output: "Hello from myFunction!" (function declaration hoisted)
function myFunction() {
  console.log("Hello from myFunction!");
}
  </code></pre>

		<h2>Why is Understanding Hoisting Important?</h2>
		<p>
			Understanding hoisting is crucial to avoid unexpected behavior in your
			JavaScript code. By declaring variables and functions at the beginning of
			their scope, you create more predictable and maintainable code. This
			practice is especially important in larger projects where hoisting-related
			bugs can be difficult to track down.
