		<h1>What's the Difference Between Undefined and Null in JavaScript?</h1>

		<p>
			In JavaScript, `undefined` and `null` both represent the absence of a
			meaningful value. However, they have distinct differences and use cases:
		</p>

		<h2>Undefined</h2>
		<ul>
			<li
				>Indicates that a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a
				value.</li
			>
			<li>Represents a lack of an assigned value by default.</li>
			<li>Returned by functions that don't explicitly return a value.</li>
			<li
				>Accessing properties that don't exist on an object also yields
				`undefined`.</li
			>
		</ul>

		<h2>Null</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Represents the intentional absence of any object value.</li>
			<li>Often used to explicitly clear the value of a variable.</li>
			<li>Considered a special object value.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Technical Differences</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>`typeof undefined` yields "undefined"</li>
			<li
				>`typeof null` yields "object" (this is a historical quirk in
				JavaScript)</li
			>
			<li
				>Strict equality (`===`) differentiates between `undefined` and
				`null`</li
			>
		</ul>

		<h2>Example:</h2>
		<pre><code>
let x;          // x is undefined
let y = null;  // y is explicitly set to null

console.log(typeof x);  // "undefined"
console.log(typeof y);  // "object"

console.log(x === undefined); // true
console.log(y === null);      // true
  </code></pre>

		<h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
		<p>
			Understanding the difference is crucial for writing robust JavaScript
			code:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Prevents errors when working with unassigned variables.</li>
			<li
				>Allows you to intentionally distinguish between uninitialized and empty
				values.</li
			>
			<li
				>Aids in debugging by providing clues about the state of your data.</li
			>
		</ul>

		<h2>Best Practices</h2>
		<ul>
			<li
				>Use `null` when you need to explicitly represent an empty or missing
				value.</li
			>
			<li
				>Avoid using `undefined` explicitly. It's better to let it occur
				naturally as a result of not assigning a value to a variable.</li
			>
			<li
				>Use strict equality (`===`) when comparing values to ensure you're
				checking both the value and the type.</li
			>
		</ul>
