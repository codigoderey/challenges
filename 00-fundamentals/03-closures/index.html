		<h1>What are Closures and How Do They Work in JavaScript?</h1>
		<p>
			In JavaScript, a closure is the combination of a function and the lexical
			environment within which that function was declared. This environment
			consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure
			was created.
		</p>

		<h2>Key Characteristics of Closures</h2>

		<ul>
			<li
				>**Inner Functions:** Closures are typically formed by defining an inner
				function within an outer function.</li
			>
			<li
				>**Lexical Scoping:** The inner function maintains a reference to its
				surrounding state (the variables in its outer scope) even after the
				outer function has finished executing.</li
			>
			<li
				>**Data Encapsulation:** Closures provide a way to create private
				variables, hiding them from the global scope and making them accessible
				only through the inner function.</li
			>
		</ul>

		<h2>Example: Closure in Action</h2>
		<pre><code>
function outerFunction() {
  let outerVar = "Hello";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVar); // Accesses outerVar from outer scope
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

let closure = outerFunction();
closure(); // Output: "Hello" (even though outerFunction has finished)
  </code></pre>

		<h2>Why are Closures Important?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				**Data Encapsulation:** Closures create "private" variables that are
				only accessible within the closure's scope. This is essential for
				building modular and maintainable code.
			</li>
			<li>
				**State Preservation:** Closures "remember" the values of variables from
				their creation environment, allowing you to maintain state between
				function calls.
			</li>
			<li>
				**Partial Application and Currying:** Closures are the basis for
				functional programming techniques like partial application and currying,
				where you create new functions with pre-set arguments.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
		<ul>
			<li
				>**Event Handlers:** Closures are often used in event handlers to
				preserve data related to a specific event.</li
			>
			<li
				>**Callbacks:** Functions passed as arguments to other functions
				(callbacks) often rely on closures to access their surrounding
				scope.</li
			>
			<li
				>**Modules:** Closures are a key mechanism for creating modular code in
				JavaScript, protecting internal variables and exposing only specific
				functionalities.</li
			>
		</ul>
